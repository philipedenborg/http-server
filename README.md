This is a C++ solution to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

"[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients."

# Instructions (Codecrafter stuff excluded)

1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally
1. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/server.cpp`.
